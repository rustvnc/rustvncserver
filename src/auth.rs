//! VNC authentication implementation.
//!
//! This module implements VNC Authentication (security type 2) as specified in RFC 6143 Section 7.2.2.
//! It uses DES encryption with a VNC-specific bit reversal quirk for challenge-response authentication.
//!
//! # Protocol
//!
//! The VNC authentication handshake works as follows:
//! 1. Server generates a 16-byte random challenge
//! 2. Server sends the challenge to the client
//! 3. Client encrypts the challenge using the password as the DES key (with bit-reversed bytes)
//! 4. Client sends the encrypted result back to the server
//! 5. Server verifies the response matches its own encryption of the challenge
//!
//! # Security Note
//!
//! VNC Authentication is a legacy protocol and has known security limitations. It should only
//! be used on trusted networks or in conjunction with TLS/SSL tunneling.
