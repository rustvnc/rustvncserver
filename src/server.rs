//! VNC server implementation for managing client connections and framebuffer distribution.
//!
//! This module provides the main VNC server functionality, including:
//! - TCP listener for incoming client connections
//! - Client session management
//! - Event routing between clients and the application layer
//! - VNC repeater support for reverse connections
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! The server uses an event-driven architecture where:
//! - Each client runs in its own asynchronous task
//! - Client events (keyboard, mouse, clipboard) are forwarded to the application via channels
//! - The framebuffer automatically notifies all clients of screen changes
//! - Server events (connect/disconnect) are emitted for the application to handle
